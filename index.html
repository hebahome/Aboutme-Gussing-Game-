    <p style="color: rgb(211, 169, 153);">But  sure you will ask me a question that make  sense! 

        " What is a relationship between your major and programming ? "
        
        Ok , I'll answer you .
        
        As a Bioinformatics lover  I joined this scholarship  with ASAC , so at the end of this course I can   solve various biological problems in Bioinformatics field !
        
        Finally , 
        Programming can be incredibly helpful to biologists and is becoming a more and more important skill for researchers to have . </p>
